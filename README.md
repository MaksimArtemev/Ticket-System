# Ticket-System
### """ Netlify, Vercel, Render as hosting platforms???   """
IT help desk ticket system that allows people to submit tickets for things such as account help and repair requests.

The system should support automatic assignment of tickets to individual IT staff members and have a built-in calendar that can support the large quantity of tickets our department receives. Additionally, the system should include both asynchronous and live chat between the ticket submitter and IT staff.

### Specifications:
Implements user authentication
Implements a dynamic database of user and item data
Implements one or more “operations” involving some form of frontend-backend-database communication
### Expectations:
Databases can use any existing dataset or have dummy data. Databases using datasets should have at least 100 items. There can be exceptions based on the specific project.
New User creation/registration should be available
UI design should contain elements commonly found or expected such as a user profile, login, logout.
Consideration for design aesthetics
System should be dynamic and responsive

### Key Features:
- User Authentication: Secure login and registration for users and IT staff, ensuring data privacy and personalized access.
- Database: Efficient management of user and ticket data, supporting over 100 items, with dummy data for testing.
- Automatic Ticket Assignment: Tickets are automatically assigned to the first available IT staff member, with manual override capabilities for administrators.
- Built-in Calendar: Integrated calendar for IT staff to manage and schedule tickets, with NO user interaction.
- UI Design: User-friendly interface with essential elements like user profile, login, logout, and aesthetic design considerations.
- Ticket questionnaire form: Users have to fill out the form providing their issue description.
- Ticket Categories: Users can select tickets from predefined categories.
- Admin Controls: Administrators can change schedules, assign availability hours, and manually override ticket assignments.
- Chat Functionality:
  - Asynchronous Chat: Allow users and IT staff to communicate regarding ticket status and details.
  - Live Chat: Separate window feature for real-time communication between users and IT staff ( We might implement it at the very end)
